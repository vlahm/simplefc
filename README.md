# **Simplefc**

### A simple command-line flash card interface.
### **Description**

Beyond grade school, rote memorization vanishes from many of our 
lives, but it happens to be a very valuable tool for retention. 
Train yourself to remember new words, friends' birthdays, or 
important political figures with simplefc. When you happen upon a 
factoid, add it to a simplefc flash card set, then practice nightly
or weekly. Practice by term, definition, or both. You can even hone
your study sessions according to how well you've performed on each 
entry.

  -m             'Many' - Exclude easy entries (those with 
                 correct:incorrect ratio >= 2). 
  -f             'Few' - Include only hard entries (those with 
                 correct:incorrect ratio <= 0.75).
  -s             Go through entries sequentially (in the order 
                 they were recorded).
